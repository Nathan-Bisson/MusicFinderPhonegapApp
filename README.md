Known Bugs
------------
When getting Events near you sometimes no events will be displayed based on your location. This because we used the Google maps -
api to take a latitude and longitude and get the city. Google is fairly specific for this so even at Algonquin it's get Neapean - 
instead of Otttawa. last.fm doesn't have Nepean, so it return no results. Another example is at my house in Orleans it get data -
for Orl√©ans, France, becuase that's what lat.fm has data for. 

Getting related songs will for smaller artists will sometimes return results for a similar song by a larger name. I tried fixing -
this by using the mbid supplied by last.fm, but not all tracks have this parameter. I chose to keep if searching for song name -
instead because more often than not the small band songs name would return correct reusults but have no mbid.
